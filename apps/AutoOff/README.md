# Auto Off

Hubitat app that turns off your devices after they have been on some time.

I have a few lights in the house that always seem to be left on.  Sometimes
the bathroom lights are left on for a few hours and sometimes the basement
lights are left on so long that I can feel the hot spots on the floor above.

I have RM rules to deal with this but this app is cleaner to maintain after
a few lights in the house.

The app allows you to select the switches you want to be turned off
automatically.  Each switch is tracked individually but they all share the
auto-off time setting.  If you need different times for different switches,
just add another instance of the app.
