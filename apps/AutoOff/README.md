# Auto Off

Turn on/off your devices after they have been off/on some time.

## Details

The app allows you to select switches you want to be turned on/off automatically.
Each switch is tracked individually but they all share the auto-on/off time
setting.  If you need different auto-on/off times for different switches, just
add another instance of this app.

## Use Case

I have a few lights in the house that always seem to be left on.  Sometimes
the bathroom lights are left on for a few hours and sometimes the basement
lights are left on so long that I can feel the hot spots on the floor above.

I had RM rules to deal with this but this app is cleaner to maintain after
a dealing with just few lights in the house.  It also took me a few times
to learn about 'Cancellable" actions in RM that are required if you use
Delay to implement this. Anyway, this app makes it all very easy.
